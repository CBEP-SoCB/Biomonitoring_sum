# Introduction
Maine DEP has developed a robust stream classification model that is based on
collecting stream invertebrates from "rock baskets" left in streams for about
a month. They have also developed methods to assess water quality based on 
comments of the algae community.  

For GIS presentation in State of Casco Bay, it is convenient to have a simple
file to import into GIS.  Here we generate that file.  This partially duplicates
a file generated in Python.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
#library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Load Data
## Establish Folder References
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fn <- "Biomonitoring_Samples_CB.csv"

# dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

DEP uses "NA" to indicate "Non Attainment" in the data.  By default, R
interprets that as `NA`, meaning  missing data.  We need to address that in our
code for reading the data.  WE also need to be careful in later analyses that
R does not drop that value.  We considered changing the data label, but DEP
uses "NA" consistently, and for simplicity of communications it is easiest if we
retain the original designation.

**Note that this data contains invertebrate, wetland, and algae sample data,
including sometimes sharing the same site designations.**
## Read the Data
### Primary Sample Data
```{r load_sample_data}
the_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), na = '') %>%
  rename_with( ~ sub(' Class| Determination| ID', '', .x)) %>%
  rename(Station = `Station Number`,
         Date = `Sample Date`,
         Type = `Sample Type`) %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format = '%m/%d/%Y'),
         Year = as.integer(format(Date, format = '%Y'))) %>%
  relocate(Attained, .after = Final)
```

### Station Data
```{r load_station_data}
fn <- "Biomonitoring_Stations_CB.csv"
station_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn), na = '') %>%
select(-contains('FID')) %>%
  select(-Sample_Typ) %>%
  rename(Station_Name = Station,
         Station = Station_Nu,
         Drainage = Major_Drai,
         Imperv = PctImperv)
```

#  Create Recent Data
Note that this data contains invertebrate, wetland, and algae sample data,
including sometimes sharing the same site designations.  

We are only interested in "most recent" invertebrate biomonitoting data.
Further, we are interested only in data that relates to the recent past. Here we
restrict ourselves to sites from the most recent  ten years of available data.
Currently, that corresponds to 2009 through 2018.
```{r}
most_recent_year <- max(the_data$Year)
earliest_recent =  most_recent_year - 10

recent_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(Type == 'MACROINVERTEBRATE') %>%
  mutate(Final_f = ordered(Final, levels = c('A', 'B', 'C', 'NA'))) %>%
  group_by(Station) %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  mutate(keep = Sample == last(Sample)) %>%
  filter(keep) %>%
  filter(Year > earliest_recent) %>%
  select(-keep, -Report) 
```

## Relate to Local Imperviousness
```{r}
recent_data <- recent_data %>%
  mutate(local_imperv = station_data$Imperv[match(Station,
                                                  station_data$Station)]) %>%
  select(-Sample)
```

## Save As CSV 
This "Most Recent" data is somewhat more convenient to work with that the one
produced in Python, in the 'access_biomonitoring' repository.
```{r}
fn = 'Recent_Stream_Biomonitoring.csv'
write_csv(recent_data, file.path(sibling, fn))
```
